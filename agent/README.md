# Agent Pipeline Visualizer - Agent Component

This component implements a configurable AI agent that simulates various steps in performance evaluation and monthly check-in processes.

## Architecture

The agent is designed with the following components:

1. **AgentBase**: The base class that provides common functionality for all agent implementations.
2. **StepBase**: The base class for implementing individual steps.
3. **Client**: A command-line interface for running the agent.

## Step Implementation

Each step is implemented as a Python class that inherits from `StepBase`. Steps are organized in folders with the following structure:

```
steps/
  step_name/
    in/     # Input files for the step
    out/    # Output files generated by the step
    step_name.py  # Implementation of the step
```

## Available Steps

### Performance Evaluation

- **data_analysis**: Analyze performance data to identify trends and areas for improvement.
- **evaluation_generation**: Generate performance evaluations based on the analysis of data and feedback.
- **create_contribution_goal**: Create specific, measurable contribution goals for team members.
- **create_development_item**: Create development items to help team members improve their skills.

### Monthly Check-ins

- **update_contribution_goal**: Update contribution goals based on the progress made.
- **update_development_item**: Update development items based on the progress made.
- **timely_feedback**: Provide timely feedback to team members based on their performance.
- **coaching**: Provide coaching and support to help team members achieve their goals.

## How to Implement a Custom Step

1. Create a new class that inherits from `StepBase`
2. Implement the `execute()` method
3. Use the provided helper methods to interact with input and output files

Example:

```python
from agent.step_base import StepBase

class MyCustomStep(StepBase):
    def execute(self) -> bool:
        # Read input files
        input_data = self.read_input_file("input.json")
        
        # Process the data
        result = self.process_data(input_data)
        
        # Write output files
        self.write_output_file("output.json", result)
        
        return True
    
    def process_data(self, data):
        # Custom processing logic
        return processed_data
```

## Running the Agent

The agent can be run in two modes:

1. **Step-by-step mode**: Run each step individually and wait for user input between steps.
2. **Full pipeline mode**: Run all steps in sequence.

```bash
# Run in step-by-step mode
python client.py --mode step

# Run a specific step
python client.py --mode step --step data_analysis

# Run the full pipeline
python client.py --mode full
```

## User Interaction

Some steps require user input before proceeding to the next step. The agent will wait for user approval in these cases.

User approval can be provided in two ways:

1. Through the web interface (recommended)
2. By pressing Enter in the terminal when prompted

## Configuration

The agent configuration is stored in `config.json`. This file defines the available steps, their dependencies, and whether they require user input.

The configuration can be modified through the web interface or by editing the file directly.

## API Integration

The agent can integrate with the backend API to provide real-time status updates and to receive user approval. The API URL can be specified when running the agent:

```bash
python client.py --api-url http://localhost:4000
```
